# Java-Programming-Practice
**Introduction to JAVA Programming and Data Structures 12E** by Y. Daniel Liang  
I am creating a repository for all of the practice exercises within my textbook for future reference.  

**Fundamentals** covers Chapters 1 - 8, which cover the following topics:
1. Introduction to Computers, Programs, and Java
2. Elementary Programming: Fundamental programming techniques with primitive data types, variables, constants, assignments, expressions, and operators
3. Selections
4. Mathematical Functions, Characters and Strings
5. Loops
6. Methods
7. Single-Dimensional Arrays
8. Multidimensional Arrays

After Chapter 7 you can jump to **Chapter 18 Recursion** to learn how to write recursive methods for solving inherently recursive problems.

I highly recommend using **Starting Out with Programming Logic and Design 5E** by Tony Gaddis.  
It not only explains how to design and develop programs, but also explains the basics of C++, Python, and Java.
