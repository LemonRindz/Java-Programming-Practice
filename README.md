# Java-Programming-Practice
**Introduction to JAVA Programming and Data Structures 12E** by Y. Daniel Liang  
I am creating a repository for all of the practice exercises within my textbook for future reference.  

**Advanced Java Programming** covers Chapters 32 - 41, and 44, which cover the following topics:   
32. Multithreading and Parallel Programming  
33. Networking  
34. Java Database Programming  
35. Advanced Java Database Programming  
36. Internationalization  
37. Servlets  
38. JavaServer Pages  
39. JavaServer Faces  
40. RMI  
41. Web Services  

After Chapter 41 you can jump to **Chapter 44 Testing Using JUnit** for testing different Java programs.  

Chapters 31 - 44 are available from the Companion Website at www.pearsonhighered.com/liang  

I highly recommend using **Starting Out with Programming Logic and Design 5E** by Tony Gaddis.  
It not only explains how to design and develop programs, but also explains the basics of C++, Python, and Java.
