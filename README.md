# Java-Programming-Practice
**Introduction to JAVA Programming and Data Structures 12E** by Y. Daniel Liang  
I am creating a repository for all of the practice exercises within my textbook for future reference.  
I highly recommend using **Starting Out with Programming Logic and Design 5E** by Tony Gaddis.  
It not only explains how to design and develop programs, but also explains basics on C++, Python, and Java.
