**Introduction to JAVA Programming and Data Structures 12E** by Y. Daniel Liang  
I am creating a repository for all of the practice exercises within my textbook for future reference.  
  
Intro to JAVA is split into five sections, which are all covered in the branches, in the following order:
1. (Ch 01 - 08) **Fundamentals**  
2. (Ch 09 - 13 & 17) **Object-Oriented Programming**  
3. (Ch 14 - 16 & 31) **GUI Programming**  
4. (Ch 18 - 30 & 42-43) **Data Structures & Algorithms**  
5. (Ch 32 - 41 & 44) **Advanced JAVA Programming**

I highly recommend using **Starting Out with Programming Logic and Design 5E** by Tony Gaddis.  
It not only explains how to design and develop programs, but also explains the basics of C++, Python, and Java.
