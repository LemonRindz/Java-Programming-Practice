# Java-Programming-Practice
**Introduction to JAVA Programming and Data Structures 12E** by Y. Daniel Liang  
I am creating a repository for all of the practice exercises within my textbook for future reference.  

**Object-Oriented Programming** covers Chapters 9 - 13, and 17, which cover the following topics:  
9. Objects and Classes  
10. Object-Oriented Thinking  
11. Inheritance and Polymorphism  
12. Exception Handling and Text I/O  
13. Abstract Classes and Interfaces  
  
After Chapter 12 you can jump to **Chapter 17 Binary I/O** to learn the difference between text I/O and binary I/O.

I highly recommend using **Starting Out with Programming Logic and Design 5E** by Tony Gaddis.  
It not only explains how to design and develop programs, but also explains the basics of C++, Python, and Java.
