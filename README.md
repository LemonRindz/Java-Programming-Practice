# Java-Programming-Practice
**Introduction to JAVA Programming and Data Structures 12E** by Y. Daniel Liang  
I am creating a repository for all of the practice exercises within my textbook for future reference.  

**Data Structures & Algorithms** covers Chapters 18 - 30, and 42 - 43, which cover the following topics:  
18. Recursion  
19. Generics  
20. Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Priority Queues: Introduces the Java Collection Framework, which defines a set of useful API for data structures  
21. Sets and Maps  
22. Developing Efficient Algorithms  
23. Sorting  
24. Implementing Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Priority Queues  
25. Binary Search Trees  
26. AVL Trees  
27. Hashing  
28. Graphs and Applications  
29. Weighted Graphs and Applications  
30. Aggregate Operations for Collection Streams  

After Chapter 25 you can jump to **Chapter 42 2-4 Trees and B-Trees** and **Chapter 43 Red-Black Trees** for different trees.

Chapters 31 - 44 are available from the Companion Website at www.pearsonhighered.com/liang

I highly recommend using **Starting Out with Programming Logic and Design 5E** by Tony Gaddis.  
It not only explains how to design and develop programs, but also explains the basics of C++, Python, and Java.
